                        Trick or Treating is one of the best aspects of Halloween
                        (or at least for children it is... I'm not sure how adults who
                        have to buy the candy feel about it). Children in costumes go around
                        their neighborhood to knock on doors, yell "Trick or Treat!" and get
                        treats in return. These treats can range from chocolates and lollipops
                        to toothbrushes and apples.

                    <b>Costumes</b> <br>
                    <span class="traditionDesc">
                        Costumes play a prominent part in Halloween; although Halloween costumes
                        were originally scary, they've evolved into being characters or concepts
                        (i.e. princesses, nurses, ballerinas, policemen).

                    <b>Haunted Houses</b> <br>
                        Haunted houses are another fun group activity to do on Halloween, typically
                        directed towards older people. People pay to enter a building full of surprises
                        and fears for fun and have a good time hiding behind their friends (but some may
                        find haunted houses boring since they're so predictable).
